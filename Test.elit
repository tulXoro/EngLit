Make a variable called "char count" and set it to 0.
Make a variable called "space count" and set it to 0.
Make "sentence" a string that is "This is a sentence".
(This for loop will go through every character in the string "sentence" and print all the characters that are not spaces.)
For every character, "c" in "sentence", do the following:
    1. If the character is a space, increment "space count" by 1.
    2. If the character is not a space, increment "char count" by 1.
    3. Print "c".

Until told to stop, do the following:
    1. Print "char count".
    2. Stop.
