# EngLit
## About
This is a high level programming language compiler that uses English-based syntax. The focus is to reduce the amount of non-alphanumeric glyphs when interfacing with a program.

## Why
Because I said so.

## Inspiration
When I first started learning how to program, I found the logic aspects of telling a computer what to do really fascinating. From there, I always wondered what it would be like to "talk" to a computer exactly like a human would.

## What EngLit is NOT
- EngLit is **NOT** meant to be a full replacement for programming languages.
- EngLit is **NOT** meant to be a perfect English language that interfaces with a computer. If you want that, see [here](https://chat.openai.com/). Building a perfect English compiler would require an immense amount of time and effort than I already have.
- As such, because there are multiple ways to say the same thing in English (*every language really is an art form*) I have chosen a specific syntax that I thought was elegant.
