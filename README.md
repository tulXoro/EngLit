# EngLit
English programming language that is meant to mimick English syntax.

## About
This is a high level programming language that heavily uses English sentences as a joke. Although there are other English-based esoteric languages, EngLit differs from them by adding unique features while still attempting to operate as a programming language.

## Why
This language was made to add synonymous keywords like `when` or `until` in ways that make sense to the programmer.
